The user is prompted to choose an option, and the program executes the corresponding task.

Option 1: Sum Numbers Until Negative Input
This method prompts the user to enter positive numbers and sums them until a negative number is entered.

Option 2: Calculate Average Until Zero Input
This method calculates the average of numbers entered until zero is input.

Option 3: Sum Until Over 100
This method sums numbers entered until the total exceeds 100.

Option 4: Password Validation
This method prompts the user to enter a password and grants access when the correct password is provided.

Option 5: Vending Machine Simulation
This method simulates a vending machine where the user inserts money until the total is sufficient to purchase a product.

Option 6: Calculate Factorial
This method calculates the factorial of a number provided by the user.

Option 7: Calculator (do...while Loop)
This method implements a simple calculator that allows the user to perform mathematical operations repeatedly until they choose to exit.
